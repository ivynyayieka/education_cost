                      <p>As you know, this is a series about why Kenya should be put in rice and left there overnight- just to see if the same miracle that works on a phone battery that fell in water can work on the country.</p>
                      <!-- <h3>East Africans consider 7 o’ clock a.m. to be one o’ clock, that is the first hour of the day</h3> -->
                      <p>This month, Kenya suggested it might pay its early childhood education teachers a mere 7000 shillings. But on prompting, they clarified that that number, in fact, only referred to basic pay without factoring in allowances. The gross salary of kindergarten teachers will continue to be capped at minimum wage of Sh. 15,120.  While the teachers’ salaries continue to be dismal, the cost of education continues to rise. </p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>This increasing cost of education as teachers earn minimum wage is happening in a country where it is cheaper to go to the best-ranked university than to go to many kindergartens. The cost of going to University of Nairobi in Kenya is just 16000 shillings thanks to government subsidies. In contrast, here are the costs of some kindergarten tuition fees:</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Despite low wages, taxes in Kenya are high. Income and corporate tax are 30%, and sales tax is 16%.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Yet even such analyses from government estimates do not represent the situation on the ground. A comparison between the cost of items according to the government’s statistics bureau compared to the cost of items at the most popular supermarkets shows the real cost of items is much higher than government data suggests. If the government has a secret corner where it is buying items from, they should at least let the kindergarten teachers in on it.</p>

                      <p>Under these conditions Nairobi’s unique time system becomes possible.In East African languages, 7 am is considered one o’ clock, that is, the first hour of the day; 8am is two o’ clock, all the way to 6pm which is the 12th hour. Afterwards, 7p.m. is considered the first hour of the night. Does it not make sense though, that we should call the first hour when the sun will for sure rise, one o’clock and the last hour before it sets 12 o’clock?</p>

                      <p>In fact, Nairobi residents swear they can tell the time better than the clock can. The sun’s position is roughly the same at the same time throughout the year. Not only that, but shadow lengths are roughly the same. The difference between the shadow length of an item one meter high is only 12 centimetres on the day it is longest compared to shortest. In comparison, for a one meter item, the difference in height on 21st June compared to 21st December in Nassau is nearly 12 meters.</p>

                      <p>This is why when you ask someone in Nairobi the time,  they can look up at the sky and down at the shadows and tell you, “It is 3.30p.m. like so like so.”</p>
                      <p>I do not know why God gifted Nairobi this perfect sunshine. Perhaps he knew we needed daylight to shine a light upon her globally ranked criminality. As parents that are desperate to find that our child is good at something, anything, we will take this deal.</p>
