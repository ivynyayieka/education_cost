In this is a project, I analysed the rising cost of education in Kenya and the low income teachers earn. 

#How I analysed rising cost of education:
I scraped the KNBS website to download the PDFs with details of Consumer Price Index every January for the last decade.  
With the results, I scraped the PDFs for tables.
With the resulting CSVs, I got the percentage rise in the cost of education and assigned 2010 as the base, giving it 100%. 

#How I analysed cost of kindergartens:
I looked at a variety of schools across different parts of Nairobi for school fees for PP1 students. 
A further analysis would focus specifically on the best ranked schools in Nairobi so that I can better compare it to the University of Nairobi school fees.

#How I analysed the cost of living
For this, I used the most recent government food basket statistics and made a waterfall chart. 
A further analysis would better match the colours to the theme. At the moment, the addition of a background image blocks the chart details and the waterfall colours appear permanent.

#How I compared prices of items
I collected data via the Glovo app on the cost of items in various supermarkets compared to the cost government statistics assigned them.

#How I analysed cost of cooking fuel and electricity
I got the data for cooking fuel and electricity over the years. I then divided it by data on minimum wage over the years to get the trend.
